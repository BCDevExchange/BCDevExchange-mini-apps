Because the web app is comprised of source code on GH and instance-specific data such as database files, instance-specific config files, environment variables etc, this requirement implies a solution must be devised to merge source code with instance-specific data.\r\n2. Implement a CI solution such that whenever a push is made to GH, the site is rebuilt automatically.\r\n3. instance-specific data should be persisted across builds as build configuration, i.e. automated CI builds shouldn't require instance-specific data as input every time, nor deleting the data supplied earlier.\r\n4. The build of web application should take place inside the container/image that runs the web application, not on the node that runs CI application, nor on the host.\r\n5. The solution should be generic enough to able to apply to other web applications, at least on NodeJS platform.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis issue is related to #223, but #223 is one of the alternatives.

Implement a CI solution such that whenever a push is made to GH, the site is rebuilt automatically.\r\n3. instance-specific data should be persisted across builds as build configuration, i.e. automated CI builds shouldn't require instance-specific data as input every time, nor deleting the data supplied earlier.\r\n4. The build of web application should take place inside the container/image that runs the web application, not on the node that runs CI application, nor on the host.\r\n5. The solution should be generic enough to able to apply to other web applications, at least on NodeJS platform.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis issue is related to #223, but #223 is one of the alternatives.

Because the web app is comprised of source code on GH and instance-specific data such as database files, instance-specific config files, environment variables etc, this requirement implies a solution must be devised to merge source code with instance-specific data.\r\n2. Implement a CI solution such that whenever a push is made to GH, the site is rebuilt automatically.\r\n3. instance-specific data should be persisted across builds as build configuration, i.e. automated CI builds shouldn't require instance-specific data as input every time, nor deleting the data supplied earlier.\r\n4. The build of web application should take place inside the container/image that runs the web application, not on the node that runs CI application, nor on the host.\r\n5. The solution should be generic enough to able to apply to other web applications, at least on NodeJS platform.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis issue is related to #223, but #223 is one of the alternatives.
