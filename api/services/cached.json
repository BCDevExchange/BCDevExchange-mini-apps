Property Assessment Data\r\n**Query Parameters:** postal code, city, street, house number and suite number.\r\n**Response:** The API would return BC Assessment data, assessment history data (if available), sales history about this property. \r\n**Actors:** real-estate website owners, data analysts & data mining analysts\r\n\r\nReal-estate website owners could enhance information about properties currently for sales (MLS & private). Users/buyers would appreciate this information in a single place. www.viewpoint.ca in Nova Scotia provides this information free if you are logged in and approved by a realtor to research listings. \r\n\r\n**Monetization:** I think some of the information should be free and part of BC Open Data (i.e. manual search and export to CSV format). Subscribers/web sites would pay-per-use model. Demand would have to be analyzed to determine various subscription/payment models. If website owners have to pay for the information, they might pass the cost to website users or to realtors. \r\n\r\n### 2. Property Sales Data\r\nGet an up-to-date list of properties sold in a date range and area.  \r\n**Query Parameters:** From Date, To Date, (optional) geographical location which could be as vague as city, postal code or neighbourhood name, but it could be a specific address for all apartments in an apartment building. \r\n**Response:** property addresses, sale price, house sq ft, lot size, year built, recent reno year, any additional information available\r\n\r\nProvide data about sold properties to help various real-estate websites and companies doing data analysis or data mining to provide more value to their users by allowing them to view properties sold within the last few years in the neighbourhood. This could help buyers make better decisions. \r\n\r\n**Monetization:** same as users case #1\r\n\r\nThe returned data could be JSON or XML depending on what the consumer prefers or whichever is easier for you.

Because the web app is comprised of source code on GH and instance-specific data such as database files, instance-specific config files, environment variables etc, this requirement implies a solution must be devised to merge source code with instance-specific data.\r\n2. Implement a CI solution such that whenever a push is made to GH, the site is rebuilt automatically.\r\n3. instance-specific data should be persisted across builds as build configuration, i.e. automated CI builds shouldn't require instance-specific data as input every time, nor deleting the data supplied earlier.\r\n4. The build of web application should take place inside the container/image that runs the web application, not on the node that runs CI application, nor on the host.\r\n5. The solution should be generic enough to able to apply to other web applications, at least on NodeJS platform.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis issue is related to #223, but #223 is one of the alternatives.

As fans of the plug and play model, we are trying to accomplish this in a modular way for obvious reasons.  Through UX testing, our audience has identified three short comings to overcome: sorting, filtering and sequential loading.  This ticket, we are going to focus on sequential loading. \r\n\r\n### Story\r\nI want to be able to interact with groupings of comments dynamically so I can restrict the information presented to me for a more effective consultation experience.\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Criteria\r\n1. A user will read through a subset of comments on a page or post and:\r\n  * select 'load more' to view the next subset of comments \r\n  * can continue to select 'load more' until all comments are present \r\n2. A user will read through a subset of replies within a thread on a page or post and:\r\n  * select 'load more' to view the next subset of comments \r\n  * can continue to select 'load more' until all comments are present \r\n3. The admin of the blog can set the number of comments and replies within a set.\r\n4. Ideally, the solution will perform these using AJAX calls.\r\n\r\n## How to contribute\r\n\r\nWe will evaluate each pull request and choose the best solution to the issue based on the acceptance criteria. Submit the best solution and you could be paid $1000.\r\n\r\nMore than one pull request may be considered for payment on this issue.\r\n\r\nPlease read the [Contribution Guidelines] (https://github.com/bcgov/citizen-engagement-web-toolkit/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the Terms that set the rules for participation in a Pay for Pull, including how you’ll get paid if you are successful.\r\n\r\nHave questions? Please post your questions in the comments section below this issue.\r\n\r\nAnd check out our [Partners page] (https://bcdevexchange.org/programs/Citizen%20Engagement%20Web%20Toolkit)  for more information on our work.",

As fans of the plug and play model, we are trying to accomplish this in a modular way for obvious reasons.  Through UX testing, our audience has identified three short comings to overcome: sorting, filtering and sequential loading.  This ticket, we are going to focus on Filtering. \r\n\r\n### Story\r\nI want to be able to filter comments by date or keywords so that I can find information more easily and participate in consultations more effectively.\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Criteria\r\n1. A user can filter information through a date field: \r\n  * by today's date\r\n  * by week \r\n  * by month\r\n2. A user can filter information through a search field, by:\r\n  * keywords from within comment fields\r\n  * keywords associated with author name\r\n3. The results will return comments, in the same default format.\r\n4. Ideally, the solution will perform these using AJAX calls.\r\n\r\n## How to contribute\r\n\r\nWe will evaluate each pull request and choose the best solution to the issue based on the acceptance criteria. Submit the best solution and you could be paid $1000.\r\n\r\nMore than one pull request may be considered for payment on this issue.\r\n\r\nPlease read the [Contribution Guidelines] (https://github.com/bcgov/citizen-engagement-web-toolkit/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the Terms that set the rules for participation in a Pay for Pull, including how you’ll get paid if you are successful.\r\n\r\nHave questions?

Open for discussion, but may never go anywhere.\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"http://bcdevexchange.org/badge/1.svg\" title=\"An idea being explored and shaped. Open for discussion, but may never go anywhere.\" /></a> \r\n\r\n# Story:\r\n\r\nAs a citizen, I would like to access a typeset PDF document of all the acts and regulations of British Columbia so I can print them. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n# Additional detail:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Queen’s Printer of British Columbia has converted all legislation in British Columbia to an XML format and given access to this information through an open API. We would like to leverage this XML data to create print ready PDF files. Some work has been done on this by creating xsl style-sheets (.xsl files) that convert the source xml document to an xsl-fo (.fo) file. The resulting xsl-fo file will then be transformed by Apache FOP into a pdf document.\r\nWe have supplied pdf examples and inDesign templates as style guidelines for how the final pdfs should look. Additial xml examples can be obtained through the BCLaws API located here: www.bclaws.ca  and documented here: www.bclaws.ca/documentation.\r\n\r\nThe process we require is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Create xsl file(s) that transforms the xml input into xsl-fo markup. `(input.xml -> transform_to_fo.xsl -> result.fo)`\r\n\r\nThe xsl files you create must be compliant with the criteria outlined below. We only require the xsl to successfully generate the .fo files and not any supporting transform specific\r\ncode you have written. For writing and testing the xsl we suggest using an editor which supports transformation using [Saxon](http://saxon.sourceforge.net/) such as [Oxygen xml editor](https://www.oxygenxml.com/) or \r\none of the many open source alternatives listed [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_XML_editors). Your resulting .fo file can then be\r\ntested using [Apache FOP](https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/) to see the resulting pdf output.\r\n\r\nThe xsl files we have supplied are to be used as guidelines but you may use the code in your own implemetation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n# Acceptance criteria:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story will be considered complete when:\r\nThe xsl files you write can be used to generate .fo files that can be used to create pdfs to match the format of the InDesign files we supplied.  The resulting PDFs should match the font, styles and content of the InDesign files located in the [docs directory](https://github.com/bcgov/bc-laws-api/tree/master/docs)\r\n\r\nAttached you will find source XML for 2 Acts, and 2 Regulations.  Your solution should be able to accuratly transform these source documents into resultant .fo file.\r\n\r\n\r\nXSL files should be written using [XSLT 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/) and be compliant with a Saxon transformer.\r\nXSL files should well documented and follow best coding practices such as those found [here](http://www.xml.org//sites/www.xml.org/files/xslt_efficient_programming_techniques.pdf). \r\n\r\n\r\nSource XML is available at the following link: [Source XML.zip](https://github.com/bcgov/bc-laws-api/files/68910/Source.XML.zip)\r\n\r\n# Please read the [Contributing file](https://github.com/bcgov/bc-laws-api/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to participate.\r\nWe would love to here from you. Please post your questions in the comments below.\r\n\r\n",

Open for discussion, but may never go anywhere.\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"http://bcdevexchange.org/badge/1.svg\" title=\"An idea being explored and shaped. Open for discussion, but may never go anywhere.\" /></a> \r\n\r\n# Story:\r\n\r\nAs a product owner I have discovered that the favourites tree is not working correctly as there is a threshold after which the favourites content tree becomes non-functional.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n# Additional detail:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGoto: http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/content/complete/statreg/?xsl=/templates/browse.xsl and click on Favourites. As a “Content Distributor” the user may already have a favourites tree but when they point a lot of content at it (Goto: http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/content/arch_oic/arc_oic/?xsl=/templates/browse.xsl) the content tree becomes overwhelmed; so as an interim solution it was removed. So it’s not so much that the piece of work is adding documents, this is done through the application layer and consumed through the API interface, but that as I add documents the trees performance degrades to an unacceptable level.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n# Acceptance criteria:\r\n\r\n1. Javascript tree contains a list of nodes that users can select.\r\n\r\n2. Tree is created using the content API as described: http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/template/complete/api/EP_API_content.html\r\n\r\n3. Selected nodes are stored in a cookie called favIDS, as a list of ancestors separated by comma. Each selection/deselection of a folder/document updates the cookie and adds/deletes the corresponding ancestor to the listTree and should default open to the lowest complete branch. Examples:\r\n\r\n\t* If “A” is selected in its entirety Tree should open to the “A” folder\r\n\r\n\t* If “Access to Education” is selected in its entirety Tree should open to “Access to Education”\r\n\r\n\t* If “Access to Education” and the “P” folder is selected in its entirety the Tree should open to both “Access to Education” and the “P” folder\r\n\r\n4. The list should also be adjusted such that if a parent is selected, the parent ancestor is added to the list and existing children ancestors are deleted.\r\n\r\n5. The Advanced favourite search feature will grab all the ancestors in the cookie. If html5 storage is present, it is used instead of the cookie.\r\n\r\n6. Tree must be able to be cleared using the clear favourites as per:\r\nhttp://www.bclaws.ca/civix/content/complete/statreg/?xsl=/templates/browse.xsl\r\n\r\n7. Tree should not substantially degrade in performance when used against larger document collections such as the Historical OIC collection:\r\nhttp://www.bclaws.ca/civix/content/arch_oic/arc_oic/\r\n\r\n8. Tree should outperform current tree load time by 3X when initially loaded with browser session information cleared. Firefox web-developer profiler will be used to determine the success of the test.\r\n\r\n# How to contribute\r\n\r\nWe will evaluate each pull request and choose the best solution to the issue based on the acceptance criteria.

      "body": "## Background\r\nWe have received feedback that developers would like the option to use their own credit card payment system instead of PayPay to receive payment for Pay for Pull opportunities.\r\n\r\n### Story\r\nAs a product owner I need to understand what financial artifacts are provided by other credit card acceptance mechanisms (other than PayPal) so that we can determine if we can use these mechanisms as part of the P4P process in the near future. \r\n\r\n## Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1.  Follow the Contributing Guidelines and send us a Pull Request to this repository.\r\n2. In the comments section of the Pull Request, include completed copy of the Pay for Pull Terms found in this repo that includes your name and email.\r\n3. In the comments section of the Pull Request, include a link to an invoice for $5 generated by your credit card payment system that must be different than PayPal.\r\n5. Upon receipt of payment generate a downloadable receipt of payment with your business information.\r\n\r\n. \r\n\r\n## How to contribute\r\n\r\nWe will evaluate each pull request and choose the best solution to the issue based on the acceptance criteria. Submit the best solution and you could be paid $5 (THIS IS TEST).\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease read the (Contribution Guidelines)[https://github.com/BCDevExchange/BCDevExchange-app/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md] for the Terms that set the rules for participation in a Pay for Pull, including how you’ll get paid if you are successful.\r\n\r\nHave questions? Please post your questions in the comments section below this issue.\r\n\r\nAnd check out our (Partners page)[https://bcdevexchange.org/programs/BCDevExchange] for more information on our work.\r\n",

Specifically:\r\n\r\n- profile page updates - I believe this now requires a database update plus some structured file edits. also, the documentation describing the process seems to be out of date.  ideally, client organizations could manage their own profile pages (following a proscribed format) and publishing would be controlled via trivial operations by team members\r\n- developer, program manger, and technical contact guides - these should be housed in an easily updatable form/location that is \"outside\" of the site and can updated by team members as needed, without requiring developer involvement. Also the publishign channel should support document constructs such as table of contents, easy navigation, etc.  GitHub Wiki seems to be a natural fit here.\r\n",

      "body": "## Background\r\nWe currently use [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/), and it's great, except for a little bug. KML Placemarks do not correctly locate when there is a KMSCORE=0 and mode=refresh for SDE EPSG:3005 polygon data. The ground overlay returned is correct, but the KML placemarks don't look like the coordinates have been converted from the native SRS of EPSG:3005. See the bug ticket here posted in the GeoServer community: [https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-7369](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-7369)\r\n\r\nWe use GeoServer for our WMS services which outputs KML of spatial data housed in the BC Warehouse. The WMS services are accessible to the public and also consumed by our services, including placemarks the BC Data Catalogue which uses the WMS for map previews of spatial data.\r\n\r\n### Story\r\nA a Government of B.C. spatial web developer, I want GeoServer to correctly locate KML placemarks so I can display spatial information accessible to the public via KML/Google Earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n\r\n1. KML Placesmarks locate properly when there is a KMSCORE=0 and mode=refresh for SDE EPSG:3005 polygon data.\r\n2. The solutions works within the GeoServer 2.8 code base.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to contribute\r\n\r\nWe will evaluate each pull request and choose the best solution to the issue based on the acceptance criteria. Submit the best solution and you could be paid $1000.\r\n\r\nPlease read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/bcgov/databc-web-map-services/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the Terms that set the rules for participation in a Pay for Pull, including how you’ll get paid if you are successful.\r\n\r\nHave questions? Please post your questions in the comments section below this issue.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in working on this issue, please let us know by posting a comment below.\r\n\r\nAnd check out our [Partners page](https://bcdevexchange.org/programs/DataBC%20Web%20Mapping) for more information on our work.\r\n",

      "body": "# Background\r\nThe OCIO is looking for the development of an online infographic for users to interact with. The purpose is to clearly convey multi-dimensional information in a user-friendly, interactive, digital format. \r\n\r\nThe work entails the development of a working prototype of a dynamic version of the [OCIO Strategic FrameWork diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcgov/interactive-infographic/master/wireframe/OCIO_Strategy_Framework.png). The prototype must enable the layout and content to change as the strategy may change over time. \r\n\r\nSee the [Readme](https://github.com/bcgov/interactive-infographic/blob/master/README.md) for more info.\r\n\r\n### Story\r\nAs a product owner, I want to be able to create a working prototype of an interactive web-app so that that I can improve the experience and understanding of government strategy by using a visual, interactive digital format.\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Develop a working prototype of a dynamic version of the [OCIO Strategic FrameWork diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcgov/interactive-infographic/master/wireframe/OCIO_Strategy_Framework.png). See this [wireframe](https://github.com/bcgov/interactive-infographic/blob/master/wireframe/wireframe.png) that illustrates how the interactive infographic might be structured.\r\n2. Allow the insertion and deletion of content boxes (i.e. rows, see [wireframe](https://github.com/bcgov/interactive-infographic/blob/master/wireframe/wireframe.png)).\r\n3. Allow the insertion and deletion of content elements (i.e. see [wireframe](https://github.com/bcgov/interactive-infographic/blob/master/wireframe/wireframe.png)).\r\n4. Content box should have the ability to contain multiple content elements that scale according to the number of content elements. Challenge us on this one if it's unrealistic.\r\n5. Allow the insertion and deletion of graphics (and perhaps text) into the content elements.\r\n6. When a user clicks on a content element (every row, or content box, should have this capability), an accordion window will expand/appear underneath. This [second diagram](https://github.com/bcgov/interactive-infographic/blob/master/wireframe/user-interaction.png) illustrates how a user might interact with the infographic.\r\n7. Allow the insertion and deletion of content in accordion windows, including text and hyperlinks (possibly graphics).\r\n8. Support vector graphics. You can use example graphics and text for the prototype.\r\n9. Provide the final product in a format that can be run on any computer (localhost) through any modern web-browser.\r\n10. Device agnostic and responsive.\r\n11. Use of commonly known, open web frameworks.\r\n\r\n## How to contribute\r\n\r\nWe will evaluate each pull request and choose the best solution to the issue based on the acceptance criteria.
