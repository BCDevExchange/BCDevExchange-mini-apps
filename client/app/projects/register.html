            <h2>What is a Project?</h2>
            <p>
                On the BCDevExchange, Projects are the containers for your work. They can be everything
                from <strong>unmet business needs</strong> that might be solved with technology to
                <strong>active development</strong> of digital resources, such as software code.


            </p>
            <p>
                Projects might include digital resources,
                such as an application programing interfaces (APIs) or piece of code. Others might be
                in the Inspiration state – an idea that needs validation before moving forward. Projects
                can also include product roadmaps, personas or other documentation.
            </p>
            <p></p>


            <h2>
                Why should your public sector organization list Projects with the BCDevExchange?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Many public sector organizations do similar things. As a result there is opportunity to
                <strong>collaborate on shared business needs</strong>. Entrepreneurs and developers can begin to help if
                they have a place to discover and understand your business needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Listing your Project on the BCDevExchange helps potential public and private sector
                collaborators <strong>find it</strong> and begin working with you.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s important that your Project has enough information for other public sector
                organizations, entrepreneurs and developers to see the opportunity to collaborate.
                For example, if your Project has a backlog of work, presenting the backlog on the
                BCDevExchange can help <strong>drive input on your Project direction, ideas and solutions</strong> —
                all geared toward a better result.
